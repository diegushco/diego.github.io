        <h3>Chicago, Illinois</h3>
        

<p>Welcome to <b>THIS IS AMERICA</b> in VOA Special English.&nbsp; I'm Faith Lapidus. And I'm Steve Ember.</p><p>This week: some places to see in Chicago.Early last century, the poet Carl Sandburg described Chicago, Illinois, as the "City of the Big Shoulders."&nbsp; That still seems right.&nbsp; Chicago does a lot of things in a big way.</p><p>For example, the city is a big transportation center in the Midwest for trains, trucks, ships and planes.</p><p>Manufacturing is one of the biggest industries in Chicago.</p><p>And Chicago has one of America's busiest ports.&nbsp; The city stretches for about 40 kilometers along the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan.&nbsp; The Saint Lawrence Seaway opened in 1959.&nbsp; It connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.Chicago is big on music.&nbsp; Visitors can find all kinds, from classical to hip-hop.&nbsp; Some of the best places for jazz and blues are along Rush Street.</p><p>There are lots of things to see and hear in Chicago.</p><p>At the Art Institute of Chicago, people can see fine Asian art and much more.</p><p>At the Museum of Science and Industry, visitors crowd a working coal mine and a World War Two submarine.</p><p>At the Adler Planetarium, people see stars and learn about space.&nbsp; And at the Shedd Aquarium, they see colorful fish and learn about life under the sea.</p><p>Not surprisingly Chicago has a lot of big buildings.&nbsp; The two tallest are the Sears Tower and the John Hancock Building.</p><p>Many people take architectural tours around Chicago.&nbsp; There are many interesting landmarks and building designs to see.</p><p>The Wrigley Building, near the Chicago River, opened in the early 1920s.&nbsp; This office building is hard to miss.&nbsp; It is bright white.</p><p>Downtown Chicago, the business center, is known as the Loop.&nbsp; There are many offices and stores.&nbsp; The Loop includes the financial district around LaSalle Street.&nbsp; The financial district is home to the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Stock Exchange and many banks.VOICE&nbsp; TWO:</p><p>Another big thing to see, and feel, is the weather.&nbsp; After all, another name for Chicago is the "Windy City."&nbsp; People turn their shoulders to the strong winds off Lake Michigan.&nbsp; In winter, Chicago gets a lot of snow; in summer, the weather is hot and sticky.</p><p>Almost three million people live in Chicago.&nbsp; Chicago is America's third largest city, after New York and Los Angeles.&nbsp; More than nine million people live in surrounding communities.</p><p>Over the years many immigrants have settled in Chicago.&nbsp; Many of its people have ethnic roots in Poland, Germany, Ireland and Italy.&nbsp; More recent immigrants have come from all over the world.</p><p>Today just under half the population of the city of Chicago is non-Hispanic white.&nbsp; The city has large black and Hispanic populations.&nbsp; Four percent of the people are Asian.</p><p>When people in Chicago want to be outdoors, one place to go is Millennium Park.&nbsp; In this City of Big Shoulders, almost everything about Millennium Park is big.&nbsp; It covers ten hectares.&nbsp; It took almost nine years to finish.</p><p>Millennium Park is on Michigan Avenue near Lake Michigan.&nbsp; It officially opened in 2004.&nbsp; It cost 475 million dollars.</p><p>Millennium Park has gardens and places for music, dance and ice skating.&nbsp; It also has one of the largest outdoor sculptures in the world.&nbsp; Anish Kapoor of Britain created this work of public art.&nbsp; It weighs one 110 tons.</p><p>A huge rounded form of shiny steel captures a looking-glass image of the Chicago skyline and the clouds above.&nbsp; The sculpture is called "Cloud Gate."</p><p>The Spanish artist Jaume Plensa designed the Crown Fountain in Millennium Park.&nbsp; The fountain is surely one of the most unusual in the world.</p><p>The artist set a pool of water between two tall glass towers.&nbsp; Video images appear on the towers.&nbsp; The images are a series of pictures of nature and people's faces.&nbsp; The water appears to pour from their mouths.&nbsp; The faces represent the many different people of Chicago.</p><p>Millennium Park has music in the Jay Pritzker Pavilion.&nbsp; The architect Frank Gehry designed this modern-looking structure.&nbsp; It can seat 4,000 people under its open-top steel ribbons.&nbsp; There is also an area called the Great Lawn to listen to the music.&nbsp; The sound system makes the music seem like it is coming from inside a concert hall.</p><p>The pavilion is a home for the Grant Park Music Festival.&nbsp; Listen as the Grant Park Symphony plays "Julius Caesar: Symphonic Epilogue After Shakespeare," Opus Twenty-eight, composed by Robert Kurka.<br /> In warm weather, people eat outdoors in the McCormick Tribune Plaza and Ice Rink in Millennium Park.&nbsp; In winter, skaters come out to enjoy the ice.</p><p>Visitors can also walk and ride bicycles in several areas of the plaza.</p><p>An indoor space has room for 300 bicycles.&nbsp; There are also places where people who ride their bikes to work can clean up and change clothes.</p><p>Another part of Millennium Park is the Lurie Garden.&nbsp; This one-hectare area is bordered by what is called the "Shoulder Hedge."&nbsp; Trees almost five meters tall form a living wall around the garden.<br /><br />"Shoulder" in this case is meant to honor the poet Carl Sandburg.&nbsp; One hundred thirty-eight kinds of plants grow in the Lurie Garden.</p><p>Many people enjoy the activities at Millennium Park.&nbsp; But critics wonder why the city needed a park so big and costly.&nbsp; They say the city should have spent the money instead on its more than 600 public schools.&nbsp; They say it could have helped the poor.</p><p>Twenty-one percent of people in the city of Chicago were living below the poverty level in 2004.&nbsp; The official poverty rate nationally that year was about 13%.</p><p>Other people say Millennium Park has improved the appearance of the area where it was built.&nbsp; The mayor and many other city leaders believed a big park would bring more people, more homes and more businesses to the area.</p><p>Mayor Richard M. Daley is the son of former Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley.&nbsp; The father is still remembered for his control over the local Democratic Party organization.&nbsp; The city has not elected a Republican mayor since 1915.Another big development, the Chicago Cultural Center, stands across Michigan Avenue from Millennium Park.&nbsp; It contains the city's official Visitor Information Center.&nbsp; It is also a showplace for the arts.</p><p>The building that now houses the cultural center was completed in 1897.&nbsp; It held the first permanent collection of the Chicago Public Library.&nbsp; It served as library headquarters until 1991.</p><p>There are white walls made of marble from Carrara, Italy.&nbsp; And there are two Tiffany domes.&nbsp; The bigger dome is one of the largest Tiffany designs in the world.&nbsp; It rises almost 12 meters above the floor.</p><p>People say the restored Chicago Cultural Center looks like a home for kings and queens.&nbsp; Some call it "the People's Palace."</p><p>Visitors can listen to all kinds of music at the Chicago Cultural Center.&nbsp; For example, Monday through Friday, there are free LunchBreak Concerts.&nbsp; Listen now to Middle Eastern music performed by Safwan Matni, a popular LunchBreak Concert guest artist.Dancers from Hubbard Street Two in Chicago have also performed at the Cultural Center.&nbsp; Hubbard Street Two is a six-member dance group.&nbsp; It trains promising dancers between the ages of 17 and 25.&nbsp; They perform works by young choreographers.</p><p>Carl Sandburg would probably not have been surprised by big projects like the Chicago Cultural Center and Millennium Park.&nbsp; The poet wrote: "Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be alive … "Our program was written by Jerilyn Watson and produced by Caty Weaver.&nbsp; I'm Steve Ember.</p><p>And I'm Faith Lapidus.&nbsp; Read and listen to our programs at voaspecialenglish.com.&nbsp; And join us again next week for <b>THIS IS AMERICA</b> in VOA Special English.&nbsp; We leave you with Frank Sinatra singing about "My Kind of Town."</p>
